## Project description
1. Some third-party libraries are not imported in NPM mode, but in static resource mode in the homepage head. Resources are placed in the public directory. 

2. The files in the public directory are exactly the same as the directories and files of `the mars3d basic project`, and can be directly copied to this directory for updating.

3. The widgets directory under public is some widget modules written in the previous traditional JS method. At present, it is not rewritten as Vue. At present, it is introduced statically for compatibility.  
  For newly developed business functions, please write them in Vue mode in SRC directory instead of using the original widget mode.
