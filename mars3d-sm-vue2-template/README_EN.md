   ðŸŒŽ Mars3D platform, the simplest application project template under the `Hypergraph +Vue technology stack`,based on vueCli 4.x

 Mars3d supports compatible use in combination with `various platforms related to cesium`, which is convenient to meet various project requirements by combining the advantages of different platforms.
 
   This warehouse is the simplest application project template of mars3d platform under [the hypergraphic cesium library technology stack](http://support.supermap.com.cn:8090/webgl/index.html).

 > Hypergraph function example, please refer toï¼š [https://github.com/marsgis/mars3d-link-supermap](https://github.com/marsgis/mars3d-link-supermap)

 > For other technology stacks, please refer toï¼š [https://github.com/marsgis/mars3d](https://github.com/marsgis/mars3d)
